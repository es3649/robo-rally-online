# RoboRally `online` client

This implements a web client for RoboRally `online` which players will use to play the game.
It will interact with the RoboRally `online` server to provide player input for the game.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
