# RoboRally `online`

RoboRally `online` is a Typescript implementation of the RoboRally board game, by Richard Garfield and Renegade Game Studio.
Since the game is very programmatic in nature, and the execution phase can often be carried out algorithmically from player input, I thought an online version of the game would be super cool, so I made one.
